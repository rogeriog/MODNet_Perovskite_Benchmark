In this repository, several tests to improve the score of MODNet in the matbench_perovskites dataset will be attempted.
The first tests include introducing features like OFM in the dataset, the OFM featurization brings too many information,
therefore we use the trained MEGNet model to classify in the different OFM clusters.
